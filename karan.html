		<h1>I am a student of KCG all the way from NEPAL</h1>
		<p>It's amazing! 
		right now, it's the monsoon. I don't know much but this is the time when people are supposed to...you know...cultivate stuff...The view you get is absolutely amazing.. 
		if you are planning to visit Nepal in this season, it probably won't be the best idea though....other than that wonderful scenery of crops and stuff all over the hill, the rain falling like diamonds on the crops, and the wonderful feeling of cool water after a scotching hot day....there is not much to see :( 
		but, as I said before, Nepal truly is amazing
